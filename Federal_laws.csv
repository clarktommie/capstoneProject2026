Specifies that a participant in an offense may not be considered a victim of the offense. <p>Directs the court, in determining whether to order restitution, to consider the amount of the loss sustained by each victim as a result of the offense, the financial resources of the defendant, the financial needs and earning ability of the defendant and the defendant's dependents, and such other factors as the court deems appropriate.  Permits the court to decline to order restitution upon determining that the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from fashioning such an order outweighs the need to provide restitution to any victims. <p>Sets forth provisions regarding situations in which there is no identifiable victim.  Directs that an order of restitution in such case be based on the amount of public harm caused by the offense. Limits the amount of such restitution ordered to the amount of the fine ordered for the offense charged in the case.

Directs the court to:  (1) order the probation officer to obtain and include in the presentence report, or in a separate report, information sufficient for the court to exercise its discretion in fashioning a restitution order (including a complete accounting of the losses to each victim, any restitution owed pursuant to a plea agreement, and information relating to the economic circumstances of each defendant); and (2) disclose to both the defendant and the attorney for the Government all portions of the report pertaining to such matters.  Directs the probation officer to inform the court if the number or identity of victims cannot be reasonably ascertained, or if other circumstances exist that make such requirement impracticable. <p>Makes specified provisions of the Federal criminal code and Rule 32(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure the only rules applicable to proceedings for the issuance and enforcement of restitution orders. <p>Directs:  (1) the attorney for the Government, upon the request of the probation officer but not later than 60 days prior to the date initially set for sentencing and after consulting (to the extent practicable) with all identified victims, to promptly provide the probation officer with a listing of the amounts subject to restitution; and (2) the probation officer, prior to submitting the presentence report, to provide specified notice to identified victims and provide each victim with an affidavit form to submit. <p>Sets forth provisions regarding:  (1) each defendant preparing and filing with the probation officer an affidavit fully describing the defendant's financial resources; (2) the court's authority to require additional documentation or hear testimony; (3) the privacy of any records filed or testimony heard; (4) final determination of the victim's losses and subsequent discovery of further losses; (5) court referral of issues arising in connection with proposed restitution orders to a magistrate judge or special master; and (6) resolution of disputes as to the proper amount or type of restitution. <p>Directs the court to order restitution to each victim in the full amount of each victim's losses as determined by the court without consideration of the defendant's economic circumstances. <p>Sets forth further requirements, including provisions regarding the form of payments, situations involving multiple defendants, a prohibition on considering the fact that a victim has received compensation with respect to a loss from insurance or any other source in determining the amount of restitution, notification of material changes in the defendant's economic circumstances, and such adjustment of the payment schedule as the interests of justice require. <p>Specifies that:  (1) a defendant's conviction for an offense involving the act giving rise to a restitution order shall estop the defendant from denying the essential allegations of that offense in any subsequent Federal civil proceeding or State civil proceeding, to the extent consistent with State law, brought by the victim; (2) a restitution order may be enforced by the United States, as specified; and (3) an order of in-kind restitution in the form of services shall be enforced by the probation officer. <p>Directs the clerk of the court, at the request of a victim named in a restitution order, to issue an abstract of judgment certifying that a judgment has been entered in favor of such victim in the amount specified in the order.  Specifies that upon registering, recording, docketing, or indexing such abstract, it shall be a lien on the property of the defendant, subject to specified limitations. <p>Specifies that a sentence that imposes an order of restitution is a final judgment notwithstanding the fact that such sentence can be subsequently corrected, appealed and modified, amended, or adjusted under specified provisions, or that the defendant may be resentenced. <p>(Sec. 207) Amends Rule 32(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to require that:  (1) a presentence investigation and report, or other report containing information sufficient for the court to enter an order of restitution, be required in any case in which restitution is required to be ordered; and (2) a presentence report contain, in appropriate cases, information sufficient for the court to enter an order of restitution. <p>Adds restitution to existing provisions governing the imposition of a fine in Federal criminal cases.  Directs the court to impose a fine or other monetary penalty only to the extent that such fine or penalty will not impair the ability of the defendant to make restitution required to a victim other than the United States.  Sets forth provisions regarding payment schedules, notification to the court of material changes in the defendant's economic circumstances, and default on a restitution fine or payment. <p>Adds restitution provisions to provisions governing the post sentence administration of fines, including collection.  Makes it the responsibility of each victim to notify the Attorney General or the appropriate court entity of any change in the victim's mailing address while restitution is still owed.  Directs that the confidentiality of any information relating to a victim be maintained.  Sets priorities for the disbursement of money received from a defendant. <p>Revises provisions regarding civil remedies for satisfaction of an unpaid fine to authorize the United States to enforce a judgment imposing a fine in accordance with the practices and procedures for the enforcement of a civil judgment under Federal or State law.  Sets forth provisions regarding:  (1) the enforcement of such judgments; (2) termination of liability; (3) liens and the effect of filing notice of a lien; (4) inapplicability of the discharge of debt in bankruptcy proceedings; and (5) applicability of specified provisions to the enforcement of an order of restitution. <p>Authorizes the court, upon a finding that the defendant is in default on a payment of a fine or restitution, to revoke probation or a term of supervised release, modify the terms or conditions of a probation or a term of supervised release, resentence a defendant, hold the defendant in contempt of court, enter a restraining order or injunction, order the sale of property of the defendant, accept a performance bond, enter or adjust a payment schedule, or take any other action necessary to obtain compliance with the order of a fine or restitution. <p>Allows any hearing arising out of such default to be conducted by a magistrate judge, subject to de novo review by the court.

Currently, the restrictions generally only apply to individuals who are convicted of a domestic violence misdemeanor against a co-parent of a child, a current or former spouse, a current or former cohabitant as a spouse, or a person similarly situated to a spouse. </p> <p>The term<em> dating relationship</em> means a continuing relationship of a serious or intimate nature, as determined based on the length of the relationship, the nature of the relationship, and the frequency and type of interaction between the individuals involved in the relationship.</p> <p>This section specifies that for individuals who are convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence against a dating partner, the federal firearms-related restrictions apply only to convictions on or after the date of enactment and expire five years after the conviction date if certain conditions are met.</p> <p>TITLE III--OTHER MATTERS</p> <p>Subtitle A--Extension of Moratorium</p> <p>(Sec. 13101) This section delays for one year the implementation of regulations relating to the treatment of certain Medicare prescription drug benefit rebates from drug manufacturers for purposes of federal anti-kickback laws.</p> <p>Subtitle B--Medicare Improvement Fund</p> <p>(Sec. 13201) This section appropriates funds for the Medicare Improvement Fund in FY2022.</p> <p>Subtitle C--Luke and Alex School Safety Act of 2022</p> <p><em>Luke and Alex School Safety Act of 2022</em></p> <p>(Sec. 13302) This section provides statutory authority for the federal clearinghouse of school safety resources. The clearinghouse identifies and publishes best practices and recommendations for school safety for use by state and local educational and law enforcement agencies, institutions of higher education, health professionals, and the public.</p> <p>(Sec. 13303) This section requires the Department of Health and Human Services and the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, and Education to notify their state and local counterparts and other partners about the clearinghouse.</p> <p>(Sec. 13304) This section requires the clearinghouse or the external advisory board to review and report on federal grant programs that could be used to implement best practices and recommendations. This section also requires the clearinghouse to identify state agencies, state grant programs, and other resources that may be used to implement best practices and recommendations.</p> <p>Subtitle D--Amendment on ESEA Funding</p> <p>(Sec. 13401) This section prohibits the use of elementary and secondary education funds to provide any person with a dangerous weapon or training in the use of a dangerous weapon. </p> <p>DIVISION B--APPROPRIATIONS</p> <p><em>Bipartisan Safer Communities Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2022</em></p> <p>This division provides FY2022 supplemental appropriations to various federal departments and agencies for programs and activities to support behavioral and mental health.
