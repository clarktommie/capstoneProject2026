Project Starter Outline

1) Data structure
   - US_STATE_LAWS.tsv: 50 states, yearly 1991–2019, 136 binary law indicators + LAWTOTAL.
   - School-shooting data: aggregate to state–year (counts, injured, killed, weapon/location attributes).
   - Join keys: STATE, YEAR; handle post-2019 incidents via carry-forward, exclusion, or sensitivity checks.

2) Policy exposure metrics
   - Overall stringency: use LAWTOTAL (and z-score variant).
   - Sub-indices (examples): prohibitors; background checks; assault weapons/magazines; carry/concealed; child access/storage; DV/ERPO.
   - Drop all-zero columns in analysis window to avoid multicollinearity.

3) Modeling strategy
   - State–year panel models: negative binomial for counts; linear/ordered for severity proxies.
   - Fixed effects: state and year; cluster SEs by state.
   - Test implementation lags (0–12 months); include policy indices or individual laws as needed.

4) Identification & design
   - Staggered adoption: use modern DID/event-study estimators; avoid negative weights.
   - Rare policies (e.g., MICROSTAMP, GVRO): consider synthetic control at state level.

5) Simulation / counterfactuals
   - Fit baseline model, then toggle individual laws or increase indices/LAWTOTAL.
   - Project changes in expected incident frequency and severity under alternative policy packages.

6) Practical steps
   - Build merged panel dataset.
   - Define 3–5 theory-driven policy indices; pre-register planned tests.
   - Run baseline and lagged robustness checks; document sensitivity to post-2019 law handling.
