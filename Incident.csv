A driver in a black Dodge pick-up truck said another driver in a white Hyundai pointed a gun at them. The driver of the pick-up then got off the highway and onto Columbus Boulevard, flagging down the school safety officer to report what happened. “At that point, the officer attempted to investigate or intervene in some way when the occupant of that Hyundai opened fire on that officer. That’s what we believe to be the case,” Pace said. “Based on what we have so far, it does appear the incidents are connected and it does appear the shooting was perpetrated by this person that originally pointed a gun at the driver.” Philadelphia School District officials confirmed the victim was working overnight at Kensington High School for the Creative and Performing Arts, which is operating as a shelter for residents who were impacted by a recent apartment fire.",Escalation of Dispute,Spontaneous,Yes,Random Shooting,No,,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Outside,No,Yes,Armed Guards,Outside/Off-Property,99,No,39.977711,-75.133571,Urban Street Standalone,19122

Three students were found with handguns. Richland County School District said in a statement that the student was injured after an airsoft pistol was fired at Ridge View High School’s campus. According to a statement sent to parents by the school’s principal, a student was injured while in a car after another fired an airsoft pistol on campus. The student's hospital records show the injury was from a bullet not a BB. Per a lawsuit, The airsoft pistol assertion was a ""spin campaign"" from the school's staff aimed at downplaying the severity of the incident, according to the lawsuit filed on May 12. The suit seeks damages from claims of negligence against the district, the student who fired the gun and that student's parents. In the lawsuit's account of the shooting, the bullet went through the student's jacket and hit him in the abdomen, leaving metal fragments. Those fragments were left alone after it was deemed more dangerous to remove them, according to the suit. Mobley told The Post and Courier that the student's paperwork from the hospital reported the injury as a ""possible gunshot wound or BB gun"" and said there wasn't an exit wound. The alleged gunshot, described as a negligent discharge, came through the window of a car the student was standing near, according to the lawsuit. All three of the car's occupants were students, and all three had handguns, the suit alleges, but there was no altercation or conflict in the lead-up to the incident.

The Marion County Sheriff’s Office said that Timothy Ward was in custody at the Marion County Jail. MCSO said that Ward entered the school about 7:20 a.m. Thursday as staff were arriving at work. According to the school district’s website, no students were on campus. The school year officially does not start until Monday. Staff immediately recognized that Ward did not belong and attempted to escort him back outside, MCSO said. MCSO said Ward then brandished a firearm in his waistband, and held two staff members against their wills. When approached again, Ward pointed the firearm at another staff member, MCSO said. An active shooter call to 911 was made at about 7:24 a.m. Marion County Sheriff Berkley Hall said the staff members quickly worked to de-escalate the situation, and a janitor was able to subdue the shooter until law enforcement arrived. The janitor held Ward until 7:27 am, when Marion County School District Police arrived and placed him in custody. “We had, I guess you would say, a responsible custodian (who) saw what was happening and got involved and actually took the suspect down right before the school resource officers arrived,” Hall said.",Hostage/Standoff,Targeted,Yes,Random Shooting,No,,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Hallway,Yes,Yes,,Failed,99,Yes,31.236058,-89.867167,Multiple attached buildings,39483

The student opened fire. The teacher later told police they expected to die. According to the SPD report on the incident, the teacher told police they were assisting students with a project when another student entered the classroom that Thursday around noon seeking the teacher’s assistance. The teacher said the student became angered and began yelling when they told the student he would have to wait. The student left, the teacher said. Moments later, he burst back into the room, this time wearing a ski mask and carrying the rifle. According to the SPD report, the student opened fire on the teacher, holding down the trigger “for 10 – 15 seconds nonstop.” The realistic looking gun was an air rifle and police say the teacher reported being struck by multiple rubber bullets. The student, according to the SPD brief, “then left the classroom without saying anything.” Before the bullets hit, the teacher said they thought the gun was real and thought they were going to die. In the chaotic moments that followed, police and emergency vehicles would swarm the campus — but not for a classroom shooting. Outside, police say Murphy-Paine was shot and killed while trying to break up a fight.

But minutes after police left, a small black car with a missing bumper drove up, and someone got out and fired “dozens of rounds,” the brother said — striking both of them. One of the students involved in the scuffle allegedly said, “Have somebody on all the exits because this is not over,” the report said. “You should cancel school tomorrow.” Security guards also informed officers another “individual” had attempted to enter the school and was gesturing inside his jacket “like he had a weapon,” according to the police report. Officers said they spoke with a school official who said Maurice Clay and another student were later refusing to leave the school gym, but said things were “under control” after the students were escorted out. Police said they stayed with Maurice Clay until his brother arrived in an Uber to pick him up. Martell Clay said he saw the police squad car when he arrived.

The student who was killed, 11-year-old Ahmir Jolliff, was shot three times. Perry High School Principal Dan Marburger and six others, including two staff members and four teenage students, suffered injuries ranging from significant to minor. The high-schooler identified as the shooter died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot. “The evidence suggests his actions that morning were indiscriminate and driven by a desire to commit suicide with the hostile intent of taking others with him,” the report states. Teen entered the school through the main entrance, concealing the weapons he was carrying, and hid inside a student bathroom for about 20 minutes, until the school started to fill up with students and staff. At that point, he emerged and started shooting, the report said. The investigation determined that the shotgun used by the teen “likely came from a large gun collection within the extended family,” and was taken without the owner’s knowledge. A revolver found on his body was legally purchased by his father in 2020 and left unsecured in the family home, according to Iowa Department of Public Safety Director Stephan Bayens.",Indiscriminate Shooting,Active Shooter/Planned Attack,Yes,Random Shooting,No,,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,Yes,Hallway,Yes,No,,Failed,23,Yes,41.840451,-94.081308,Multiple attached buildings,50220

The incident occurred on the evening of Oct. 6 during a game between Thibodaux High School and Hahnville High School. Law enforcement officials providing security at the game reported hearing 5-6 gunshots from outside the stadium’s west side shortly before 8:30 p.m. The sound triggered a stadium evacuation, prompting authorities and school officials to suspend the game and clear the premises. Despite an immediate search by officers from both the Thibodaux Police Department and Lafourche Parish Sheriff’s Office, no crime scene, victims, or property damage were identified on the night of the incident. However, a medical event involving a student-athlete was reported, though it was clarified to be unrelated to the shooting, and no injuries linked to the gunshots were recorded. The investigation revealed that the gunfire followed a fight between two groups of juveniles in the stadium parking lot.

Police say the suspect tried to enter the building but couldn’t get inside. Class was not in session, but there were limited staff and construction workers there at the time. In an affidavit, police said Bowman — who had attended the school — walked around its exterior and fired two shots at the contractor, who was not hit. Bowman then fired two more shots outside the school before driving away in a pickup truck, police said. Officers tracked down Bowman a short drive from the school. He exited his truck with a gun in his right hand and pointed the weapon at an officer, who shot him, police said. Bowman was hospitalized in critical condition. Friend said he was diagnosed with PTSD, perhaps stemming from his father’s death in 2003, when police fatally shot him during a mental health episode. He said doctors recently changed Bowman’s medication and he noticed Bowman’s behavior change.

Officers on traffic detail found “multiple victims.” Acting Police Chief Rick Edwards says a total of seven people were shot. A family spokesperson confirmed An 18-year-old Shawn Jackson and his 36-year-old father, Renzo Smith, died as a result of their injuries. A 31-year-old is suffering from life-threatening injuries. Edwards also confirmed four other males, ages 14, 42, 55 and 58, were injured but are expected to be okay. Six other people sustained injuries unrelated to the gunfire, three reported needing to be transported to the hospital for anxiety, two were injured from falls and a 9-year-old was hit by a car as they were running away from the area. That child is also expected to be okay. Police have a 19-year-old man in custody that they believe was involved in the shooting. He is expected to be charged with two counts of second-degree murder with more potential charges. Police also think the suspect knew at least one of the victims. Richmond Public Schools confirmed the shooting happened outside the theater after Huguenot High School’s graduation ceremony and occurred in Monroe Park adjacent to the theater. The district says they have canceled all high school graduation ceremonies this week. Richmond Police said there were four total guns recovered from the shooting scene near Monroe Park at North Laurel and West Main Street. Police said Pollard had one gun, police confirmed. Another person, not directly involved in the shooting and who never fired gunshots, was found with the second gun, police said. Police have not yet said to whom the remaining two guns belonged.

Jackson-Smith told 8News she witnessed a teen boy run up behind her son and open fire. “My son was walking toward me, and I seen the boy run up behind him and just start shooting him from behind,” she said. “My son was walking toward me. My husband was walking behind my son, but somehow the boy ran around everybody and ran behind my son.” Shawn Jackson and his stepfather, Renzo Smith, were shot dead. Several other people were shot and injured. Police later identified the gunman as 19-year-old Amari Pollard, adding that the victim and suspect knew each other and had an “ongoing dispute.” Jackson-Smith said she was unclear on what the dispute was about but confirmed the two knew each other. “They were friends. He used to stay at my house when they were little kids since they were like 8 years old,” she said. “My son told me, about four-five months ago, that he was going to see him, so I didn’t even know that they were having a problem. When you think of people that your child considered a friend… and somebody stayed in your home… you wouldn’t think that they would be that angry at you that they would take their life from you.

Judge Thomas C. Branca imposed the sentence as part of a plea agreement. The judge ordered Moses to forfeit the handgun to the county district attorney’s office for destruction. The investigation began at 9:42 p.m. Feb. 8 when Upper Providence police responded to the high school campus at 350 S. Lewis Rd. for a report of an armed subject and altercation outside the school gymnasium during a basketball game between Pottstown and Norristown high schools, according to a criminal complaint. Witnesses reported they observed a verbal altercation between juvenile males in the parking lot outside the gymnasium. An employee of the Pottstown School District reported that during the altercation, she observed a 15-year-old Pottstown boy brandish a firearm from his front sweatshirt pocket, “making it visible for anyone in the vicinity,” according to the criminal complaint filed by Upper Providence Police Officer Jacob Richard Allen. The witness said the teenager “was shouting and during the commotion he continued to pull the firearm from his pocket.” The witness added “a large crowd was exiting the gymnasium and the fact that someone had pulled a gun created a sense of panic in the crowd and they fled, running away from the altercation,” Allen alleged. A second adult witness said that when she went to separate the teenagers she heard Moses tell the 15-year-old boy, “Give me back the gun.” The witness reported seeing the 15-year-old boy remove a firearm from the front of his sweatshirt pocket and hand it to Moses, police said. The investigation determined Moses possessed a Glock semiautomatic 9mm handgun on the high school campus. Additionally, Moses gave her firearm to the 15-year-old boy, who was a minor and not permitted to possess a firearm, during the altercation with other juveniles, police alleged.",Escalation of Dispute,Spontaneous,Yes,Both,Yes,Woman gave teen the gun,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Outside,No,,,Failed,0,No,40.189396,-75.525025,Single building indoor hallway,19468

Four students remained with Gushwa voluntarily until he gave up, police said.

Matthews had just begun his daily routine of explaining what would be on the students’ agenda when Gushwa pulled a gun. Gushwa ordered the teachers into another room and fired a shot into the ceiling above a door, police said. The principal, secretary, teachers and about half the students made it out of the school after Gushwa pulled the gun. After police refused Gushwa’s initial demand for liquor and cigarettes, he agreed about 90 minutes after the standoff began to trade a .22 semiautomatic for three packs of Marlboros.

Brewer High School at around 8:28 a.m. on May 21, 1985. That vehicle eventually left the area, but Biles noticed the vehicle again at around 1:16 p.m. Four minutes later, Deputy Biles radioed in, stating he had been shot and needed assistance. He had reportedly approached the driver’s side of the suspicious vehicle to ask for their ID when he saw the barrel of a semi-automatic rifle. While trying to push the barrel of the gun away from his head and toward the driver, authorities say Biles heard a click. “As he reached for the barrel, he heard a “click” but did not know if it was the safety or the hammer on the weapon. Just as he touched the barrel, he heard the weapon fire and felt his chest burn,” the MCSO said in their post remembering Biles. The vehicle was driving away, but not before it is said Deputy Biles got a few shots in and even hit the suspect’s gas tank, causing him to run out of gas in Cullman County. Cullman County authorities were notified by a couple who had been listening to scanners that the out-of-gas vehicle was at Hebron Church. A Cullman County Deputy and a Blount County Deputy approached the car and the suspect, directing them to throw the weapon and exit the car. It was reported that the suspect was a minor and former Brewer High student armed with a semi-automatic rifle, two rifle clips, 372 rounds of ammunition and a knife and dealing with mental health issues. That subject was later convicted on capital murder charges but committed suicide in prison in 1989.",Indiscriminate Shooting,,Yes,Both,No,,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Outside,Yes,,,Outside/Off-Property,1,,34.413209,-86.705568,,35670
