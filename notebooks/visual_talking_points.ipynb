    "- This visual shows the full data lifecycle: **Raw Sources -> Extract -> Transform -> Load (Supabase) -> QA Checks -> Derived Tables -> Notebook Analytics**.\\n",
    "- The key message is that analysis results are not direct raw outputs; they come after standardization, key harmonization, and validation.\\n",
    "- QA is explicitly in the pipeline (duplicate checks, missingness checks, year-range checks), which protects against misleading trend conclusions.\\n",
    "- Derived tables (`national_enrollment_trend`, `incident_rate_per_100k`) are purpose-built for analysis and reporting speed.\\n",
